This is a program to correlate TP-Link smart bulb brightness and hue with the sleep wake cycle associated with the sunrise and sunset.

It uses a raspberry pi for retrieving the local sunrise/sunset times and also for issuing the commands sent to the bulbs. The commands sent change the color temperature and brightness of the bulbs to attempt to match the sunlight in the environment. 

Recent studies have shown that the wavelength of the ambient light in our homes and work spaces plays a role in our natural circadian rhythm and thus can have an impact on our sleep^[citation] 

The aim of this project was to take advantage of the color changing properties of TP-Link Smart Bulb L130 to mitigate the harmful melatonin supressing effects of short wavelength light, and thus improve sleep quality.
